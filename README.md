# Minecraft Data Science Project

This repository contains my DSCI 100 individual planning report.
The project uses data from a Minecraft research server to explore player behaviour and newsletter subscription patterns.

## Data Description

The dataset includes two CSV files:
- players.csv — information about each player (experience, subscription, gender, age, etc.)
- sessions.csv — information about each play session (start time, end time, duration, player ID).

Data were collected automatically from a Minecraft research server at UBC.


## Project Questions

Broad question:
What player characteristics and behaviours are related to newsletter subscription?

Specific question:
Do players with more experience or longer playtime tend to subscribe to the newsletter?
## Methods Summary

The project uses R to load, clean, and summarize the data.
Simple descriptive statistics and visualizations are used to explore relationships between experience, playtime, and newsletter subscription.
